# Description

This repository contains Dockerfiles and devcontainer features for developing and building various cross-platform apps, notably GUI Java apps that rely on Swing or JavaFX.
Alpine-GUI-Java is a x64 image only, as there is no OpenJDK release for Alpine on ARM processors. Other images should be hardware-agnostic.
